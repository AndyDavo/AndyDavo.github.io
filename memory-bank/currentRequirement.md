Cross-Linking Strategy
To tie everything together, I recommend implementing these cross-linking strategies:

Solution → Use Case Links: Each solution should link to relevant use cases that demonstrate its application.
Stakeholder → Solution Links: Each stakeholder page should link to relevant solutions that address their needs.
Use Case → Stakeholder Links: Each use case should indicate which stakeholders benefit most.
Technology → Solution Links: Each technology component should connect to the solutions it powers.

This architecture provides flexibility to incorporate your three industry use cases and three stakeholder perspectives once you define them, while maintaining a clear organization that highlights both your technical capabilities and their practical applications.
Would you like me to elaborate on any particular section or provide more specific recommendations for any part of this archit
